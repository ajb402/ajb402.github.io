  My name is Alex Bitchatchi. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida, and currently a senior at the University of Miami, but will be graduating this May. I’m majoring in Broadcast Journalism with a minor in Sport Administration. Sports broadcasting has been a dream job of mine since I was six years old. I’ve had a passion for pretty much all sports, as well as listening to some of the great play-by-play broadcasters in the business. Now, with the opportunities I have at UM, I’ve been a play-by-play broadcaster, as well as color commentator and producer for WVUM 90.5 FM, the University’s student run radio station. I’ve had the privilege to call games for Hurricanes football, baseball and men’s and women’s basketball both at home and road trips for the last three years. It’s been an incredible experience so far, and wanted to share some of my favorite calls from my time broadcasting. Enjoy!
